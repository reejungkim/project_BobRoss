1. Who is Your Customer? (The Beachhead Market)
- Beachhead Market: "The Aspiring Digital Parent." Parents who want to draw with/for their kids but feel they lack the talent.
- End User Profile: 30–45 years old, owns an iPad/Tablet with a stylus (Apple Pencil), values creative bonding time, and feels intimidated by professional art courses.
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): Calculation of the number of tablet-owning parents globally (initially focusing on South Korea/US) multiplied by a potential annual subscription of $30–$50.


2. What Can You Do for Your Customer? (Value Proposition)
"Bob Ross" element comes in. The app shouldn't just "filter" the photo; it should teach the process.

High-Level Product Specification: 
    1. AI Decomposition: The app takes a photo (e.g., a pet dog) and breaks it down into simple geometric shapes (circles, triangles). 
    2. Layer-by-Layer Guidance: "Let's start with a happy little circle for the head." 3. Real-time Feedback: Using the camera or screen-overlay to tell the user if their proportions are correct.

    Quantified Value Proposition: Reduce the time it takes to produce a "recognizable" sketch from 5 hours (learning via YouTube) to 15 minutes (using the app).

3. How Does Your Customer Acquire Your Product?
Decision-Making Unit (DMU): * Champion: The parent or the hobbyist.

Influencer: Social media (TikTok/Instagram Reels of "Before vs. After" sketches).

Sales Process: * Short-term: Freemium model on the App Store (first 3 sketches free).

Medium-term: Partnerships with stylus manufacturers or tablet brands.
